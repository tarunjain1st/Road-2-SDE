Q576. Out of Boundary Paths

ðŸ’¡ Approach:
The code employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore possible paths in a grid. At each step, it checks if the current move is within the allowed limit. 
If it exceeds, the path is abandoned; if the position is outside the grid, a valid path is found. 
The magic lies in the memoization technique, saving previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.



ðŸ“ˆ Time Complexity: O(m * n * maxMove),
The memoization ensures that we only compute unique subproblems, significantly reducing the overall time spent on calculations.

ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity:  O(m * n * maxMove).
The memoization table, represented by the dp array, stores only necessary information, preventing excessive memory usage. 
This makes the algorithm memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large grids or numerous possible moves.
